# The Needle Drop Score Predictor

In this project, I'm going to try and predict the score Anthony Fantano (melon) will give an album/ep **before** he gives it.

To achieve this, I'm going to train a model using sentiment scores from YouTube auto generated subtitles, number of best tracks, number of worst tracks, day of the year (Julian calender), and _maybe_ external album scores from Metacritic

## Dataset

Kaggle dataset from [here](https://www.kaggle.com/jaredarcilla/anthony-fantano-reviews)

**Note:** I've slightly modified the original fantano_reviews.csv file and included it in the anthaony-fantano-reviews zip under the name fantano_reviews_modified
